# Blitz Portfolio Template

---

Hello there, I see you've chosen the `portfolio` template and have managed to successfully build your website. From here onwards, I suggest you do 3 things:

* Click through this website to see the contents of every page and see what Blitz can do.
* Take a look at the Blitz content files in `content` directory and Pug templates that were used to generate this website, which can be found in `templates`. A good place to start would be the `content/index.md` file - inside you'll find the very text you're reading right now. Try to edit it and run `blitz build` again. Then, open `blitz.yml` and try to understand how everything is linked together.
* Keep in mind, this website doesn't make use of all Blitz's features so you might check out [Blitz's website](https://getblitz.io) for the docs.
